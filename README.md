Where to play your game https://inzodion.github.io/D3-CoolJump/

How your design satisfies the experience requirements below

How all of your data assets (if you have any) were created:
- all assets were created by me in photoshop, the only one to use already exsisting assets is rightplayer.png, that was used with two different sprites that I made transparnt then edited them together, then made to correct size.
The pixel.png asset was created by me in photoshop

Hoenstly for the gameplay experence wise I did my best with what I could look up and with help from others. There are different physical aspects too the game like the charcter moevement, the charcter being able to go from the right side of the screnn and appreaing on the left and vice versa, the charcter bouncing on the platforms, the blue platforms dissapering after they are boucned on, and the spring propelling the charcter higher.
